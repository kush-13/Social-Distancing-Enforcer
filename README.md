# Social-Distancing-Enforcer
COVID-19 can be defeated easily by implementing Social Distancing . But Athorities have found it very difficult to Implement because they ca'nt be everywhere every time. In these tough times our Iot Device can act as a effective tool to monitor density of people  in a given region by sensing the radio-activities of their smart phones in a given region. Hence it can warn the respective athorities when ever the density of people increases in the given region .
